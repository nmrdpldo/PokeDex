# PokeDex

This app is an implementation from Philipp Lackners Pokedex series in his youtube channel(Link to the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCTimTCpEL5FZgaWdIZQuB7m).

Just added to my github repo to have my own copy just in case anything happens to his pokedex repo.
This will serve as my personal reference for Jetpack Compose + MVVM with repository pattern and some other features that was included on the series.

Thank you Philipp! 😁
